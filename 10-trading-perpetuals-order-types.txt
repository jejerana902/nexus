Orders are instructions to buy or sell assets at specified conditions. They define what, when, and how trades should execute on the exchange.
Nexus supports a diverse range of order types and configurations:
Market:
Executes immediately against resting liquidity; any unfilled size is canceled.
Limit:
Placed at a specific price and stays on the order book until filled or cancelled. Filled at selected limit price or better
GTD (Good-Till-Date): Stays live until the chosen expiry or when the order fills.
IOC (Immediate-or-Cancel): Fills what it can instantly, cancels the rest.
Stop:
Stop Market: A market order that is executed at the best market price when mark price reaches selected market price
Stop Limit: A limit order that is only executed at selected limit price after mark price reaches selected trigger price.
Market close orders:
Automatically-size to fully close your current position, canceling any resting or untriggered orders before closing automatically.
Reduce-only orders:
Ensures the order can only decrease your current open position size.
Limit: Limit reduce-only orders automatically adjust if a subsequent order reduces your current position
