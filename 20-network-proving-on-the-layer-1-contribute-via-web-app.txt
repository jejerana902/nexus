Introduction
Testnet III is now live.
This is the current testing environment for Nexus Layer 1, focusing on security, decentralization, and orchestration testing.
The Nexus App —
app.nexus.xyz

— provides a browser-based way to contribute compute to the Nexus Network. No installation required.
Under the hood, the Nexus App runs a high-performance Rust-based WebAssembly (WASM) runtime, allowing users to contribute computation securely and efficiently with a single click — directly from their browser. There’s no technical setup or prior knowledge required.
The web app also serves as the primary dashboard for managing all aspects of your participation:
Start or stop compute contribution with one toggle.
Track your NEX Points in real time.
Manage linked CLI nodes and wallets.
Redeem rewards and monitor leaderboard performance.
