Title: Margining | Nexus Docs
Scraped: 2026-01-30 09:47:32 UTC

Margining on the Nexus DEX is executed natively inside NexusCore, the enshrined financial coprocessor suite that powers the DEX. Nexus Layer 1 is designed to support both cross and isolated margin.
In the DEX Alpha, only isolated margin types will be available.

Initial Margin Requirements
When opening a leveraged position, traders must post initial margin, defined by the maximum leverage allowed for a given market.
Initial margin ensures sufficient collateral at entry and is verified atomically by the DEX Co-processor before an order is accepted into the orderbook. The initial margin calculation follows the formula:

Because margin validation runs inside NexusCore, traders benefit from:
Deterministic enforcement
(no race conditions from asynchronous contract calls)
Sub-second execution
aligned with block times
Atomic settlement
with order placement
This ensures both speed and safety at the protocol level.

Maintenance Margin
Maintenance margin is the minimum margin that must be preserved to keep a position open. Falling below this threshold makes a position eligible for liquidation. Each market has its own maintenance margin fraction, calculated as:

Liquidation Process
Positions are liquidated when the mark price from the Nexus Oracle System causes equity to fall below maintenance margin. Refer to the
