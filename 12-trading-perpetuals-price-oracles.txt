The Nexus Price Oracle System provides fast, reliable, manipulation-resistant spot index prices for all perpetual markets on the DEX.
Oracle prices are a foundational component of the NexusCore risk engine and are used for:
Mark price calculation
Funding rate computation
Margin requirements
Liquidation triggers
Triggering TP/SL and conditional orders
Oracle updates are published every
~3 seconds
, ensuring accurate and timely tracking of global spot markets.

Design Overview
Nexus uses a validator-published, multi-source, volume-weighted oracle for spot pricing in the
DEX Alpha
.
This design draws inspiration from validator-driven mechanisms but replaces stake-based weighting with market volume-based weighting, creating a more market-neutral and liquidity-reflective system.
Every validator independently computes a spot oracle price for each supported asset using aggregated data from major centralized exchanges and, when appropriate, Nexus-native markets.
hashtag
Validator Responsibilities
Each validator continuously:
Fetches spot mid-prices
for each asset from supported exchanges
Computes a volume-weighted median
across these sources
Publishes an updated oracle price
roughly every 3 seconds
Signs and broadcasts
the price to other validators and the network
These prices are then aggregated into a final L1 oracle price consumed by NexusCore.
hashtag
External Data Sources
Validators query spot mid-prices from a diverse set of high-liquidity exchanges, including:
Binance
OKX
Bybit
Kraken
KuCoin
Gate.io
MEXC
Each source contributes to the oracle calculation using a predefined
volume-based weight
, reflecting the global liquidity share of each venue for that asset.
