Dual-Block Execution
To achieve predictable performance, NexusCore participates in a dual-block architecture:
NexusCore blocks execute continuously at 50–100 ms intervals for real-time trading and risk operations.
NexusEVM blocks occur every 4–10 Core blocks, providing synchronization and composability between NexusCore and NexusEVM.
This scheduling ensures that NexusCore operations never wait for EVM overhead, maintaining deterministic latency across financial workloads.
To achieve high performance, Nexus introduces a high-frequency dual-block architecture.
It features fast NexusCore mini-blocks providing high-frequency and low-latency orderbook transactions,
and slower NexusEVM blocks featuring the full programmability of the EVM.
