Testnet III is now live.
This is the current testing environment for Nexus Layer 1, focusing on security, decentralization, and orchestration testing.
This page explains the transition from
Nexus Layer 1 Devnet
to
Testnet III
. This documentation covers the Devnet closure and how we’re moving forward to Testnet III.

Devnet
The Nexus Devnet was a testing environment for experimental features from February 22 to June 20, 2025. By design, NEX Devnet Points were for testing purposes. Devnet is officially closed as of June 20, 2025. Here’s what this means for participants:

What Happens to NEX Devnet Points
All users with NEX Devnet Points have been converted to Devnet Tokens and are now available in their wallet. During Devnet, users earned
Devnet Points
by proving via Nexus OS or CLI and then
claimed
them to convert them into
Devnet Tokens
.
Important: Everyone who participated in Devnet now has all their Devnet Points converted to Devnet Tokens in their wallets. If you had unclaimed Devnet Points, the system auto-claimed them for you, so you didn’t lose anything.
hashtag
Testnet III launch
When Testnet III launches, certain areas that used to show NEX Devnet Points and Devnet Tokens will now show NEX Testnet III Points and Testnet III Tokens.
hashtag
Proving via Nexus OS or CLI
When you start to prove via Nexus OS or CLI, you will earn NEX Testnet III Points, not NEX Devnet Points.
Because Testnet III is a new environment, you will not have any Testnet III Points at the start. You cannot convert NEX Devnet Points to NEX Testnet III Points.

Nexus OS wallet
