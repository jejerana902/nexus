Install Node.js and npm if not already installed
Then install Hardhat:
Install Hardhat
Copy
npm
install
--save-dev
hardhat
Hardhat is a development environment and task runner for Ethereum that helps developers compile, deploy, test, and debug smart contracts. The --save-dev flag ensures Hardhat is installed as a development-only dependency, keeping it separate from production dependencies.

Configure Hardhat for Nexus
Create or update
hardhat.config.js
in your project root to define the network configuration, RPC endpoint, and chainId used for signature verification:
hardhat.config.js
Copy
require
(
"

"
)
.

require
(

Configure your private key in
.env
Get your private key from Nexus:
Go to the Nexus Web App: https://app.nexus.xyz/
Sign in to your account in the top right corner
Click the “Settings” tab
Navigate to “Account & Security”
Click on “Private Key”
Click “Reveal” to view your private key
Create your
.env
file in the project root and add your private key:
.env
Copy
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
Install
dotenv
:
Install dotenv
Copy
npm
install
dotenv
Ensure
hardhat.config.js
includes:
hardhat.config.js (top)
Copy
require
(

Important Security Notes:
Never share your private key
Never commit it to version control
Keep it secure and backed up
Use a test account for development

Receive test NEX from a faucet for contract deployment
To deploy on Nexus Layer 1 you’ll need NEX tokens to pay gas fees. You can receive test NEX in two ways:
Earn NEX through Proving — submit proofs to earn points and NEX in real-time. For details see the Proving Guide: https://docs.nexus.xyz/layer-1/network-devnet/web-node
Use the Nexus Faucet: https://faucets.alchemy.com/faucets/nexus-testnet
Note: Faucet amounts are sufficient for basic deployments. For extensive testing, consider earning NEX through proving.

Writing and Deploying Your First Contract

Create a contract file
Create
contracts/Lock.sol
. This default Solidity example demonstrates core concepts such as sending and holding ETH, using block timestamps, events, and enforcing access control with
msg.sender
. It implements a timelock wallet: it requires an
unlockTime
(future timestamp) and an ETH payment in the payable constructor; funds are locked until
unlockTime
, and only the deploying address can withdraw.
contracts/Lock.sol
Copy
contract
Lock
{
uint
public
unlockTime
;
address
payable
public
owner
;
event
Withdrawal
(
uint
amount
,
uint
when
);
constructor
(
uint
_unlockTime
) payable
{
require
(
block
.
timestamp
<
_unlockTime
,
"Unlock time should be in the future"
);
unlockTime
=
_unlockTime
;
owner
=
payable
(
msg.sender
);
}
function
withdraw
()
public
{
// Uncomment this line, and the import of "hardhat/console.sol", to print a log in your terminal
// console.log("Unlock time is %o and block timestamp is %o", unlockTime, block.timestamp);
require
(
block
.
timestamp
>=
unlockTime
,
"You can't withdraw yet"
);
require

msg.sender

"You aren't the owner"

Create a deployment script
Create
scripts/deploy.js
. This script deploys your contract to the Layer 1 network, handling constructor parameters, async deployment, logging, and preparing for contract verification.

require

Deploying your contract
To deploy to the Nexus network:
Deploy command
Copy
npx
hardhat
run
scripts/deploy.js
--network
nexus
Expected terminal output:
Example output
Copy
Copy
Deploying Lock contract...
Lock contract deployed to: 0x...  # Your contract's address will appear here
Save the deployed contract address to interact with the contract later.

hashtag
Examine the Lock contract on the Nexus Explorer
Visit the Testnet III Nexus Explorer: https://nexus.testnet.blockscout.com
To find your contract:
Copy your contract’s address from the deployment output
Paste it into the search bar at the top of the explorer
Click on your contract to view details (code, transaction history, balance, interactions, events)
hashtag
Project structure
Your project directory should look like this:
Project tree
Copy
my-first-contract/
├── contracts/
│   └── Lock.sol
├── scripts/
│   └── deploy.js
├── .env
├── hardhat.config.js
└── package.json
contracts/: Solidity smart contracts
scripts/: Deployment and interaction scripts
.env: Stores your private key and other sensitive data
hardhat.config.js: Configures your development environment
package.json: Manages project dependencies

Conclusion and next steps
Congratulations! You’ve successfully:
Set up your development environment
Created and deployed your first smart contract
Verified your contract on the Nexus Explorer
Recommended next steps:
Read the Solidity documentation: https://docs.soliditylang.org/
Study OpenZeppelin Contracts: https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts
