Positions represent your active exposure in markets on the Nexus DEX. Each position maintains a live state within the NexusCore risk engine, tracking your entry price, size, collateral usage, funding, fees, and real-time profit and loss.
Positions are updated every Core block, ensuring near-instant feedback on risk, margin, and liquidation thresholds.

Open Positions
Your open positions panel displays continuously updated metrics derived from the CLOB co-processor’s real-time risk engine:
Unrealized PnL
— shown in both USD value and percentage
Position Size
— total notional exposure (long or short)
Average Entry Price
— volume-weighted entry across fills
Margin Usage
— collateral allocated to maintain the position
Liquidation Price
— the estimated price at which the risk engine will liquidate your position
Funding Payments
— funding paid or received since opening
All calculations follow the deterministic margin and funding rules enforced inside NexusCore’s financial state machine.

Modifying Positions
Active positions can be managed through various methods to adjust your exposure or exit trades. Updates are applied atomically via the Core matching engine.
Adjusting Position Size
You can increase or decrease your position size via market or limit orders using the standard trading modal.
Orders in the opposite direction exceeding your current position size will automatically "flip" your positions.
For example, if you have 1 BTC active long and place a market sell for 2 BTC, you'll end up with 1 BTC active short.
Closing Positions
Exit a position partially or in full from the Positions tab.
Closing executes a market or limit order on the opposite side and immediately realizes PnL after the fill.
hashtag
Position History
Track and review trading activity with transparent historical data through the Position History tab.
