NEX Testnet Points and NEX Testnet Tokens are Nexus’s native reward system for recognizing user and developer participation during testnet phases. The system is for testing purposes only and is subject to change.
NEX Testnet Points and NEX Testnet Tokens during Testnet III are distinct from those accumulated in earlier testnets and devnets.
To view NEX Testnet Points from previous testnets, log in to your Nexus account with the original email that you used to register.
Users cannot use NEX Testnet Points from previous testnets to claim NEX Testnet Tokens during Testnet III.
In the future, you may be able to earn points and tokens in a variety of other ways through your on-going participation in the Nexus ecosystem.

Why did my points go to 0 on June 24?
hashtag
Your NEX Testnet Points are safe and still being tracked. All of your NEX Testnet Points, both claimed and unclaimed, have been converted to NEX Testnet Tokens and transferred to your wallet. As a result, all claimed and unclaimed NEX Testnet Points will show up as 0 in your claim history.
All points earned before 3:00 PM PT on June 24 have already been converted to NEX Testnet Tokens and sent to your wallet.
Contributions made after 3:00 PM PT on June 24 are still being tracked and will appear in your account.
This is due to a maintenance update to Testnet III, and no points have been lost. No action is needed on your part.
