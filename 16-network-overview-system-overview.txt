System Overview
Nexus is a Layer 1 blockchain that integrates high-performance execution, deterministic consensus, and verifiable computation into a unified protocol architecture.
The system is structured as a three-layer model (Execution, Consensus, and Verification) which cleanly separates runtime computation from block production and long-term trust minimization.

Execution Layer
The execution layer consists of two parallel state machines:
NexusEVM
— an Ethereum-compatible environment for general-purpose smart contracts, and composable application development.
NexusCore
— a high-performance runtime hosting
enshrined co-processors
, each implemented as an independent, deterministic state machine optimized for specialized financial operations.
Both environments execute concurrently and communicate via atomic cross-domain message passing, ensuring a single, globally consistent execution state across
NexusEVM, NexusCore
and
Cross-Domain
states.
This dual-execution model resolves the programmability–performance trade-off by allowing developers to retain full EVM flexibility while leveraging CEX-grade computational paths for latency-sensitive logic.
hashtag
Consensus Layer
The
NexusBFT
protocol finalizes blocks, validates execution commitments, and governs the activation and evolution of co-processors.
Each block contains:
A Merkle commitment to the execution state
Validator signatures and metadata
Optional registry updates that modify the set of active co-processors via
CPregistry
Nexus enables protocol-level extensibility without hard forks or execution-layer disruption, by placing co-processor registration and lifecycle management in the consensus layer.
hashtag
Verification Layer
The verification layer provides trustless validation of the entire chain through the
Nexus zkVM
, a zero-knowledge virtual machine.
The
Nexus Network
generates these proofs, progressively compressing chain execution into a single recursive Universal Proof. This architecture enables horizontally scalable validation where even low-resource devices can independently verify the chain.
hashtag
Design Goals
The system is engineered to achieve:
High-frequency execution:
Sub-100 ms Core latency and sub-second EVM confirmation.
Composable programmability:
Seamless integration between general smart contracts and specialized co-processors.
Deterministic coordination:
Predictable block timing and atomic cross-domain operations.
Progressive verifiability:
zkVM integration enables recursive proof aggregation for full-chain validation.
Scalable decentralization:
Performance scales with hardware and validator participation, not fragmentation across rollups.
hashtag
Summary
Nexus unifies execution, consensus, and verifiable computation into a single architecture capable of delivering high-performance financial computation with mathematically provable correctness. By embedding verifiability directly at the base layer and enabling deterministic, parallel execution through co-processors, Nexus provides a foundation for globally scalable applications, markets, and autonomous agents
