What is Nexus?
hashtag
Nexus is building a Layer 1 blockchain for the AI era – a world supercomputer that gets more powerful with each connected device. Nexus makes it easy for anyone to contribute compute power from any device, even a laptop or phone. With just one click, users can connect at
app.nexus.xyz
arrow-up-right
to start earning rewards and help scale a verifiable network built for the AI economy.
chevron-right
What are the Nexus Testnet and Nexus Devnet?
hashtag
Testnet is the public testing environment for the Nexus ecosystem. When available, Devnet is a public-facing environment used for testing under development features.
There have been several testnets and one devnet so far:
Testnet 0:
October 8 – 28, 2024
Testnet I:
December 9 – 13, 2024
Testnet II:
February 18 – 22, 2025
Devnet:
February 23 - June 22, 2025

Can I participate in the Nexus testnet?
hashtag
Yes, anyone can participate by creating and logging into a Nexus account at
app.nexus.xyz
arrow-up-right
or by registering a CLI node at
app.nexus.xyz/nodes
arrow-up-right
and running the Nexus CLI with that node id. In doing so, your device becomes a node, contributing compute power to the network.
Nexus is designed to scale verifiable computation through a unique architecture where our servers assign workloads—programs and inputs to be proved—to each connected node. Every node operates a Nexus zero knowledge virtual machine (zkVM), which uses cryptographic techniques to verify computations.
Unlike other blockchains, the Nexus testnet gets more powerful with each connected device, so your contributions matter.
chevron-right
Why should I contribute compute power?
hashtag
By participating in the Nexus testnet, you're helping develop and test a world supercomputer to make the internet verifiable – where every action can be proven, every AI model audited, and every interaction verified.
Users play an essential role in helping develop and test the Nexus ecosystem. They equip the Nexus blockchain with the speed and scalability required to support AI systems at global scale.
Also, if you log in to your Nexus account, you can earn rewards, such as points and tokens, for your contributions. More on that below.
chevron-right
How do I create a Nexus account?
hashtag
To create a Nexus account, simply follow the steps to connect your email or wallet. Once your account is set up and you connect to the network, you'll automatically start earning NEX Testnet Points and appearing on leaderboards.
chevron-right
Can I use multiple devices to contribute compute power?
hashtag
You can link and manage multiple devices including desktops, laptops, mobile phones, and servers all from a single account. There's no need to create separate accounts for each device. You can even prove computations in multiple browser tabs at once, with each tab utilizing one CPU core.
chevron-right
What is happening when I am contributing compute power?
hashtag
Your device proves computations in the form of software programs assigned by Nexus's server. These computations verify the integrity of each program. Here's what happens step by step:
Your device connects to the Nexus network, and runs its own instance of the zkVM.
The Nexus network sends a program and its input data to your device.
The Nexus zkVM, which is running on your device, executes the program, generating a proof.
Your proof is submitted to the network, along with performance metrics.
Your account will earn rewards such as points and tokens for your contributions. More on this below in Points and Tokens.
The process repeats as long as your device remains connected.
chevron-right
What's the difference between connecting my device through the Nexus web app and running the CLI from my device terminal?
hashtag
Logging into a Nexus account at app.nexus.xyz enables users to contribute compute power from their device to the network effortlessly via a web browser—with no technical knowledge required. It is also the main dashboard for managing and overseeing all your contributions across devices. The Command Line Interface (CLI) is designed for more advanced users running provers on dedicated machines looking to customize compute power contribution by device.
chevron-right
Can I buy a pre-installed prover from a third-party provider?
hashtag
Yes, there are a number of third-party providers that provide one-click setup to users. However, because these are third-party vendors, Nexus will not be able to provide assistance with setup or troubleshooting.
chevron-right
What is the maximum amount of nodes I can create?
hashtag
Users cannot create more than 100 existing nodes. Delete existing nodes or create a new account if you need more than 100. Users are rate limited to creating 50 nodes per day.
hashtag
Nexus DEX Alpha
chevron-right
What is the Nexus DEX Alpha?
hashtag
The Nexus DEX Alpha is Nexus's testing environment for decentralized exchange functionality, allowing users to test trading, liquidity provision, and other exchange features using testnet tokens with no real economic value.
chevron-right
How do I access the Nexus DEX Alpha?
hashtag
Nexus DEX Alpha access may be provided through your existing Nexus account at
app.nexus.xyz
arrow-up-right
or through separate DEX-specific interfaces. Specific access instructions will be provided when the Nexus DEX Alpha becomes available.
chevron-right
Can I use real money or tokens in the Nexus DEX Alpha?
hashtag
No. The Nexus DEX Alpha uses only testnet tokens with no monetary value. No real assets can be traded or at risk in the Nexus DEX Alpha environment.
chevron-right
What happens to my Nexus DEX Alpha positions?
hashtag
All Nexus DEX Alpha positions, test tokens, and trading history are temporary and for testing purposes only. They may be reset, modified, or eliminated at any time without notice.
chevron-right
Are there rewards for Nexus DEX Alpha participation?
hashtag
Nexus DEX Alpha may include its own reward system separate from compute testnet rewards. Any such rewards are for testing purposes only and have no monetary value.
hashtag
Points and Tokens
